# WindowsOptimizer
My idea is to boost the performance of windows using a batch file,
It might include
1. Deleting temporary files
2. Turning off the unnecessary things that might slow down the pc
3. Changing some system settings to boost performace

Current Goals
1. Need to fecth the startup apps
2. Disabling all of them, except essential apps (eg: Windows Security)
3. Need to convert this bat file to exe, to achieve this CI/CD pipeline running on master branch might be good option. 
4. If HDD is present, we need to do defragment operations
